## Stormraven Sisters ##

When Strahd's lust for power drove him to make his fateful pact with the Dark Powers of the Amber Temple, the sisters followed without hesitation. They stood at his side on the night he seized Castle Ravenloft, aiding him in slaughtering his enemies and securing his throne. But they did not anticipate what he had become. That night, when Strahd descended upon his own soldiers and feasted upon their blood, the sisters hesitated for the first time. Even their loyalty wavered as they realized their master was no longer a man, but something else—something monstrous.

Strahd, sensing their doubt, gave them a choice:

    "Swear yourselves to me once more, body and soul, and I will grant you the gift of eternity. Or resist, and die as all the others did."
    
    Elandra was the first to kneel, her oath still binding her to the Von Zarovich name. She had given everything for Strahd’s cause—she would not turn away now.
    Seraphine, ever fascinated by the secrets of undeath, saw an opportunity for power beyond anything she had known. She embraced the darkness willingly, eager to explore the limits of her newfound immortality.
    Kaelin, however, was not so quick to yield. The youngest sister had always been the most independent, the one who could vanish into the night without a trace. She tried to flee. She did not make it far. Strahd hunted her down himself, cornering her in the depths of Castle Ravenloft. When he found her, he did not strike her down. 
    
    Instead, he whispered: "You of all should know, little bird—there is no escaping the shadows."


Now, as undead creatures bound to Strahd’s eternal reign, the sisters serve as his personal executioners and enforcers. They are whispered of in fearful tones, known as the Stormraven Daughters of the Night.
- Elandra, the Bloodblade: The warrior wraith, her greatsword infused with the hunger of a predator. She leads Strahd’s forces when open battle is required, cutting down his enemies with cold efficiency.
- Seraphine, the Deathbinder: The necromancer, weaving her spells in the name of her dark master. She gathers and controls the dead, ensuring none escape Strahd’s dominion.
- Kaelin, the Shadowfang: The assassin, the unseen hand that deals in whispers and poison. She hunts those who defy Strahd, ensuring none escape the mists of Barovia alive.

Though they have long since given themselves to darkness, a small ember of their past selves still lingers in the deepest parts of their minds. In fleeting moments of solitude, they wonder—did they choose this fate? Or had Strahd’s will already claimed them long before that fateful night? But such thoughts are dangerous. And so they bury them, drowning them in blood, steel, and the cold embrace of eternity. For they are the Stormraven Sisters, and the will of Strahd is all that remains.

And so, she too was turned, her resistance shattered, her will remade in Strahd’s image. That night, the Stormraven Sisters were reborn—not as warriors of honor, but as enforcers of the Count’s will. 

They cannot easily be killed, like the creature that sired them..
