Letter from Lord Geoffrey Frostmantle to Mistress Clarissa Allyson

In the Name of the Crown,

Mistress Allyson,
The bearer of this letter comes to you in dire times, under my authority and with my trust. They are tasked with reaching you on matters of utmost urgency. The shadows that have spread across our land have deepened, and I fear the darkness has now fully taken hold. 

The Prince, my nephew, Ian Frostmantle, is gravely wounded. I am doing what I must to secure his survival, but I cannot fight this battle on two fronts. You have long been the keeper of knowledge and wisdom, and now, more than ever, we need that wisdom to understand what has befallen us. The creatures and mist—this evil—must be tied to something darker than what we had imagined.

I have entrusted these brave souls to deliver this message to you, and I beg that you give them your guidance. They carry with them the hope of all of Damara. Assist them in any way you can, and uncover the magic that plagues our land.

I will seek refuge and tend to the Prince, but time is not on our side. The battle we fought was only the beginning. What you learn may be the difference between the survival or the end of our people. Trust them as you would trust me. Together, we may still have a chance to turn the tide.


In service to the realm,

Lord Geoffrey Frostmantle

Lord of Westwatch, Protector of the Western Reaches
