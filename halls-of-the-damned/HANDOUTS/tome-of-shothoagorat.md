# Tome of Shothragot Book # 

1.1 The keep shall be made hollow. Of those who rest in hollowness, they shall not be seen.  And the World shall shake and be riven. And from the cracks shall rise The Shadow Mist.

1.2  In the darkness of the new moon it will shroud all the lands. Of those who build mightily, stone by stone, so shall they fall, stone by stone.

1.3  And the depths of the Shadows shall bring forth flying spectres and crawling beasts. In their passing the worm grows fat, the vulture weary

1.4 Doubt is crowned. The loyal shall turn their blades on those who silver they gave. And blood-cough shall spread like fire across the wastelands that remain of the world

2.1 As at the beginning, so at the end, all manner of fly and pest shall fill the air. And the ground  pale with maggots. 

2.2 From the Spears; a frost. Birthed from the Shadow and covering all before them. And SHE shall see HIM grow stronger. And SHE reveals her true self and ALL shall be slain.

3.6 And hunger shall come among you. You shall dig roots and pull children from the breast. The gaunt shall prey upon the gaunt.

3.7 The great shall be made poor and the poor poorer still. Brother shall slay brother and Sister shall poison Sister. 

4.1 The Dark God is know by many names; The Ender, The Black Sun, He Who Waits, The Eater of Worlds, The Elder Elemental Eye, The Chained God

4.2 The lakes and rivers shall blacken and brackish. The trees shall wither, shrivel, and die. Birds shall fall dead from the sky.

4.3 In one night as the new moon approaches, all those not yet of seven years and seven days shall pass. Born and unborn. And death shall give them life as eaters of men. 

5.3 The sky shall weep blood and fire as a great stone shall plummet as a city fallen from the heaven. Its gift is Death and madness is its herald.

5.4 And the last Lord and his Lady shall wither to dust. Their sacrifice devoured by the darkness they gave birth. 

5.11 You shall know the last day is come. The sun shall sit but never again rise. And day shall be as night and night as the dark of the deep. You shall not wake, nor shall you ever sleep. 

6.3  Tharizdun shall have his will and drink all colour from the world. His darkness shall shade all the worlds. 

6.16 All suffer and kneel before Tharizdun , the shadows nightmare, the avatar of Tharizdun, and reaper of worlds. All praise the fire which burns all! And the darkness shall swallow the light.
