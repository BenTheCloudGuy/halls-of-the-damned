#  Keeper of the Lore #

**[The scene opens with a dark, star-filled sky, panning down to a vast, ancient temple partially buried and overgrown. The camera moves inside, revealing a grand hall lined with statues of forgotten gods. A soft, ethereal voice begins to narrate, echoing through the halls.]**

*"Our story begins in an age of darkness, a time when chaos reigned supreme. It was an era long before the worlds of man, before even the ascendant deities of today, when the Elder Gods wove order from the primordial chaos of the Astral Sea. In this cosmic forge, the Elder Gods birthed the Younger Gods, who then shaped the realms and worlds we now inhabit."*

*Among these firstborn was Tharizdun, a god of unparalleled ambition and intellect. For millennia, he wove alliances, growing in power and stature within the divine pantheon. But it was a fateful discovery that sealed his doom: a shard of unknown material, radiating arcane might. The shard's dark power twisted Tharizdun’s ambition into madness, driving him to create the Abyss—a plane of pure evil and chaos. From this accursed realm, he summoned the first demons to serve him.*

*Consumed by his own madness, Tharizdun believed that true salvation lay in the annihilation of all things. Viewing his fellow Elder Gods as unfit to rule, he waged a war against them, leading his demonic hordes and the gods who followed him in a devastating conflict known as the Dawn War.*

*For eons, the Dawn War raged across the planes. New creatures were forged for battle, and gods fell to weapons of their own creation. Worlds were shattered. Yet, it was not divine might that ended the conflict, but the ingenuity of mortals. Humanity found a way to chain Tharizdun, binding his essence to the chaotic realm he had spawned. Tricked into believing he had achieved victory, Tharizdun was left to slumber in his delusion, imprisoned in his own creation.*

*Throughout history, Tharizdun’s followers have sought to free their chained god, each attempt thwarted by the vigilant forces of order. Among these acolytes, none were more formidable than Shorthagot, Tharizdun’s avatar—a being birthed from the Abyss itself, embodying his master's will. Shorthagot manipulated the greatest arcane minds of Netheril to create a device capable of awakening Tharizdun.*

*But heroes rose to oppose him. A group of mighty paladins, champions of Faerun, defeated Shorthagot’s allies and used the very machine he had devised to imprison him. Bound by divine, mechanical, and magical forces, Shorthagot was cast into the Plane of Shadows, his prison slowly weakening as ages passed and the Netheril Empire crumbled.*

*Now, whispers of chaos stir once more. Agents of destruction walk among us, seeking to awaken Shorthagot and use his infernal machine to free Tharizdun. Should they succeed, the Chained God will rise, and all creation will tremble before his madness.* 

**[The camera fades to black, the Keeper’s voice lingering as an ominous echo. The scene shifts to the players, standing on a dock about to board the Sea Spray.. Unaware of what is coming..] **
