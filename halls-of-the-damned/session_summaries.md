The journey began with the crew of the Sea Spray leaving Frosthaven, setting sail toward Damara. For the first few days, nothing of note occurred as the crew settled into life aboard the ship. On the third day, as the Sea Spray passed through Bloodstone Pass, strange figures were spotted in the fog along the banks. Captain Reaven reminded everyone to be cautious, as Damaran laws were strict regarding unsanctioned use of magic. That night, shortly after midnight, as the crew settled down for another quiet evening, the ship was suddenly attacked by two large shadowy creatures that came crashing through the mist. Their attack sent the ship careening toward the rocky shore of the river. The crew leapt into action, with Korith climbing up to fight one of the creatures, while Sage was struck by the terrifying sonic scream of the Night Screamers, leaving her paralyzed. Merrick quickly responded, using his healing magic to keep Korith in the fight. Meanwhile, below deck, the ship began filling with ice-cold river water. The players grabbed their belongings and rushed topside, following the hulking shape of Kurtha. In the heat of battle, Gregor fired off a powerful shot from his pistol, while Krutha and Korith’s weapons slammed down on the creatures. Sage, Nina, and Merrick closed in as the second creature broke free and charged after the rest of the crew. After the creatures were dealt with, the Sea Spray was left in ruins, with broken wood, scattered supplies, and blood covering the deck. The eerie glow from the lanterns flickered through the fog, and the sound of the ship’s creaking timbers was the only thing breaking the silence. Then, from the mist-shrouded woods, a voice called out in desperation, asking for aid in the name of King Frostmantle. Two figures emerged, one barely standing and being supported by the other. The larger man, covered in blood and dirt, dragged the younger, gravely wounded man forward. As they came closer, the symbols of Damaran royalty were visible on their cloaks. The larger man raised his head and urgently pleaded for help, revealing that the injured man was none other than Prince Ian Frostmantle. Sage rushed to heal the prince, but as she focused on him, her mind was suddenly transported to a series of unsettling visions. She found herself standing in a barren landscape littered with massive dead creatures, before being thrust into a ruined city with the remains of a family clinging to a child. The third vision saw her floating in the Abyssal Sea, surrounded by bright orbs of light that sought to invade her mind. Despite the overwhelming presence of this force, Sage resisted, but the experience left her mentally drained as she returned to reality. The prince, still grasping her, collapsed back into unconsciousness, his fevered mumbling continuing. With the situation far from resolved, the players were given a map by Lord Frostmantle to head to Valls, where they were to seek information from Mistress Clarissa Allyson and return with word as soon as possible.

### Game Date: 04-14-2025

Leaving the wounded Prince and Lord Ian Frostmantle in the capable hands of Captain Reaven and the loyal crew of the Sea Spray, your fellowship ventured into the shadowed wilderness toward an old church. Guided by the keen eyes of your two Rangers, you soon found yourselves swallowed by the suffocating embrace of a dark, mist-shrouded forest. An unsettling stillness hung heavy on the air, broken only by the distant echo of a woman sobbing—a mournful sound you chose, perhaps wisely, to avoid. Your passage was haunted by spectral murmurs carried on the restless breeze: "Ashes fill the skies of Valls," they whispered, and "Do not fail me, little bird." Most troubling of all, the ominous voice warned, "The Prince is lost," leaving you to wonder at the source and meaning of these cryptic portents. Hours into your journey, you stumbled across a gruesome scene: the mutilated remains of a woman, victim to the ferocious jaws of Hell Hounds, the only testament to her identity—a child’s small doll, pristine amid ruin. As you pressed on, the Rangers' instincts guided Gregor to a hidden Ranger's hideaway. Before curiosity or caution could prevail, Krutha’s impulsive strength came crashing down upon a locked chest, destroying two precious health potions within but leaving a single silver dagger intact. It was then, in the heart of shadow, that a frightened cry pierced the night. Without hesitation, you raced toward the sound, discovering young Kaelin Stormraven trapped within the branches of a twisted tree, amber eyes wide with terror as Hell Hounds snarled hungrily below. In moments, your blades and spells swiftly felled the infernal beasts, rescuing the girl. Kaelin, grateful yet shaken, told of her desperate flight from Valls with her mother and their ill-fated caravan, scattered and destroyed by monstrous assailants two nights prior.	Together, you pushed onward through the lingering darkness until, as dawn stretched timid fingers across the sky, the silhouette of the abandoned church rose solemnly before you. Awaiting you at the threshold stood two weary knights—the last survivors of Lord Ian's retinue—beckoning you inside the sanctuary where hope and darkness converge. It is here, in the shadow of this ancient church, that your tale resumes.

### Game Date: 04-28-2025

After a harrowing journey through the mist-choked wilderness, the party arrived at the crumbling ruins of the Old Church—an isolated refuge nestled near the West Road, where survivors of the prince’s retinue had taken shelter. There, they were greeted by Ser Brennor Cale and a handful of battered knights, all that remained of the escort that had once protected Prince Frostmantle. Among them were nearly two dozen refugees from Valls, hollow-eyed and haunted, who spoke of the city's fall—how nightmare creatures stalked its streets, how the dead now walked, and of a shadowy four-armed being that could drain the life from a man with a single touch. Father Alric, the aging priest of the church, welcomed the adventurers with warm stew and soft words, offering a few precious hours of peace.Exhausted, Sage found rest quickly, the young Kaelin - rescued hours earlier from the jaws of Hell Hounds—nestling close beside her. As the others made ready for the road to White Bridge, Gregor explored the surrounding grounds and, in the snow-wreathed ruins, bonded with a lone hunting dog—more wolf than canine. It was a quiet morning, filled with murmured plans and the rustle of supplies. And then the stillness shattered. Kaelin struck without warning. Her form twisting into an young woman, revealing something cruel and cunning beneath the innocent mask. In one smooth motion, she slit Father Alric’s throat, then vanished in a shimmer of arcane mist—reappearing behind Sage to drive twin psychic blades deep into her back. The young druid crumpled, blood soaking into the frost. Chaos erupted. Krutha and Korith charged in, weapons flashing, driving the assassin back while the others rushed to revive Sage. Merrick, now a monstrous bear, tore into Kaelin with savage fury., while Sage, barely revived, hurled her magic in retaliation. Kaelin, retreating into the branches of a nearby tree, flung three glowing red pearls into the sky—a delayed fireball detonated in a thunderous explosion, engulfing friend and foe alike. As the smoke cleared, Gregor fired true, wounding Kaelin. But it was Sage rising to her feet, her skin scorched and her eyes burning with betrayal, who then summoned the wild power of the earth. With a furious cry, she thrust her hands forward, and from the twisted ground beneath Kaelin, a massive vine coiled like a serpent, lashing upward to rip the assassin from the treetop and slam her hard against the frozen earth. Before Kaelin could even recover, Sage closed the distance and stomped the ground with divine fury, unleashing a thunderous shockwave that cracked stone and hurled Kaelin like a ragdoll into the very tree she was just pulled out of. Kaelin, broken and desperate, used her final Misty Step to vanish once more—reappearing behind Sage and plunging her dagger into the young druid’s back for a second time whispering in Sages ear; "My Master will not so easily be defeated" as Sage fell—but not before whispering a final, damning curse herself. Fire erupted from her body in a Hellish Rebuke, engulfing Kaelin in infernal flame and reducing her to nothing but ash. All that remained was a scorched satchel, filled with strange coins, an unrecognizable metallic marker, and a letter addressed to “Little Bird.” It warned of Lady Williams and bore the signature of her shadowy master: S. Bloodied and shaken, the party gathered their strength. Sage, alive but barely, was steadied by her companions. At Gregor’s side, the wolfish hound followed the party. And before you stretched the West Road, leading into the heart of darkness—toward the fallen city of Valls.

In the hushed stillness following Kaelin’s fall, the pounding of hooves broke through the dawn mist. Ser Brennor Cale arrived, flanked by three weathered knights. He took one look at Father Alric’s lifeless form and knew the truth without a word spoken. At Krutha’s firm urging, the First Sage’s body was given to flame—to ensure no dark power could claim him. The fire crackled, its glow washing over solemn faces as a final prayer to Lathander, god of renewal and light, was offered into the wind.

As the flames dimmed, a young half-elf named D’ethra stepped forward. In gratitude, she offered to examine the relics the party carried. With a quiet murmur and a flicker of arcane sight, she revealed the truths:

- The Dagger of the Restless Hunt, a silvered blade blessed by forgotten vampire hunters. It hums in the presence of undead—and strikes with unnatural precision against the creatures of the night.
- And The mysterious Marker, an ancient talisman woven with protective magic. While worn, it dampens the aura of life… making it harder for the undead to notice or seek its bearer.

With few knights left to ride, Ser Brennor gifted the party three horses, hard-eyed and worn from the road. As they set off under a slate-gray sky, Sage exhausted barely in the saddle quickly drifted into sleep. The West Road unfurled through dead hills, where spring had not yet banished the cold. A foul stench rode the wind—carrion and corruption. Black-winged vultures circled overhead.

Then you saw the bodies. Dozens. Men, women, children. Refugees of Valls, struck down mid-flight. Some still clutching satchels and their belongings. Over fifty lives, taken in brutal haste. And worse still—the attackers had come from the same direction as the party, meaning they too are heading toward Valls. Among the dead, a letter. Bloodied. Burned. Bearing the seal of the Yellow Rose with a message to Father Alric from Mistress Allyson.. Mistress Clarissa Allyson warns that Valls has fallen and entrusts Father Alric as the final guardian, revealing that the Key has been sent east with Brother Caelis and the Dawn Guard to the warded ruins of the Old Monastery. Night was falling when the party reached the ruined village of West Gate. Fire-scorched and empty, it stood like a ghost beside the walls of Valls. Entering the city by night was folly… so they took shelter in the remnants of a home, barring the door and watching the shadows creep. The hours ticked by. And with them came the dead. Their moans grew closer. Louder. Hungrier. Just before dawn, two Ghouls—“roof goblins,” as Korith grimly quipped—crept across the crumbling shingles. Gregor loosed the first shot, shattering the stillness. Krutha and Gregs new  hound Dagger moved to guard the lone entrance below. Above, Merrick raised his hands—and with a word, a searing Moonbeam pierced the clouded sky, turning the advancing horde to ash. The battle surged. Dagger took a savage blow defending his master—only to lunge upward and tear the Ghoul’s throat from its neck. On the other roof, Sage’s vine whip lashed out, dragging another shrieking Ghoul to the ground where Merrick’s holy light found it. 

Then… silence. But only for a breath. Beyond the broken walls, more howls rose. The dead were still out there. And the sun… had not yet risen.
